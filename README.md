<h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<h3><br></h3>
This is a presentation of a regression analysis I created to find out the current state of affairs of data science career salaries. Some questions I answer are:<br>
- What kind of title makes the most money in data science careers?<br>
- If I wanted X role, how likely am I to get a remote job?<br>
- Does remote work have a positive or negative correlation with salary?<br>
- Does company size relate to salary?<br>
- How does experience level per job title affect salary?

<h2><strong>Future Considerations:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Using new data with SQL joins to create a custom table to analyze.</li>
<li>Using data with more incremental measurements instead of small scale grades.</li>
<li>Focus on a topic with a broader use.</li>
</ul>
