Project Overview Description: A dissection of salaries within a data science career based on factors such as geographic location, company, job title, etc.
Purpose: With this data, we can use some analysis to see if salaries have changed throughout the few years since 2020 until 2022 to predict how salaries will be in 2023. We can also use this data to see what factors could help a job seeker earn more money.
Background on research problem: As someone finishing up a data analysis/data science bootcamp and will be entering the job market for these very same roles soon, I wanted to see how the job market will look for myself. With my background within tech recruitment and working for software engineering schools such as this one, I can utilize these data skills with my knowledge of the economy to help make important career choices.
Existing research: Most salary reporting sites and major universities have done independent research on salaries within data science roles. As time passes, the business cycle ebbs and flows, and the economy is affected by new technologies and societal changes, constant research and studies need to be tested and updated to view the outlook on data science as a career.

Questions:

- What kind of title makes the most money in data science careers?
- If I wanted X role, how likely am I to get a remote job?
- Does remote work have a positive or negative correlation with salary?
- Does company size relate to salary?
- How does experience level per job title affect salary?
